# Roman Numerals

##Learning Competencies

* Use methods to modularize code
* Use data structures to map relationships
* Write small, concise methods
* Write DRY code
* Use effective naming conventions


##Summary

We're going to write a method that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent, i.e., 476 => 'CDLXXVI'.

For reference, these are the building blocks for how we encode numbers with Roman numerals:

| Roman Numeral | Arabic Numeral |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| I             | 1              |
| V             | 5              |
| X             | 10             |
| L             | 50             |
| C             | 100            |
| D             | 500            |
| M             | 1000           |

### Roman Numerals as Representation

Have you ever seen a 5? I don't mean the symbol we write on a piece of paper or print to a screen, but an actual, honest-to-goodness 5?

Of course not. You've seen things that somehow embody five: five apples, five fingers, five weekdays on the calendar, a scrap of paper with "5" written on it, and so forth. Think of all the ways you can represent the integer 5.

Symbols like 5, "five", V, and IIIII are one way. If you asked a three-year-old, they might hold up the five fingers on their hand or pull out five pennies from their pocket. Computers encode numbers as a sequence of 0s and 1s called [binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number).

[The map is not the territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), as they say.


##Releases

###Release 0 : Old-school Roman numerals

In the early days of Roman numerals, the Roman's didn't bother with any of this new-fangled subtraction 'IX' nonsense. No sir, it was straight addition, biggest to littlest–so 9 was written 'VIIII' and so on.

Write a method `to_roman` that when passed an integer between 1 and 3000 returns a string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral.

In other words, `to_roman(4)` should return the string `'IIII'`.

Make sure to test your method by passing it several inputs whose results you know. Test some simple numbers like `to_roman(1)` and more complicated numbers like `to_roman(1646)`. This serves as a good sanity check.

Hint: Use the integer division `/` and modulus `%` methods.

###Release 1 : Modern Roman numerals

Eventually, someone thought it would be terribly clever if putting a smaller number before a larger one meant you had to subtract the smaller one. As a result of this development, you must now suffer.

Rewrite your previous method to return the new-style Roman numerals so when someone calls `to_roman(4)`, it should return the string `'IV'`. You might want to run a script like this to make sure your program is working as intended:

```ruby
puts "My totally sweet testing script"
puts ""
puts "input | expected | actual"
puts "------|----------|-------"
puts "4     | IV       | #{to_roman(4)}"
puts "9     | IX       | #{to_roman(9)}"
puts "13    | XIII     | #{to_roman(13)}"
puts "1453  | MCDLIII  | #{to_roman(1453)}"
puts "1646  | MDCXLVI  | #{to_roman(1646)}"
```

#### Examples

| Arabic | Roman  |
| ------ | ------ |
| 4      | IV     |
| 9      | IX     |
| 14     | XIV    |
| 44     | XLIV   |
| 944    | CMXLIV |


##Optimize Your Learning

Reflect on the pros and cons of each representation. Imagine you're an engineer building a system for people to manipulate numbers and you have two proposals before you: use Roman numerals or use the [Arabic numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals) we use today. How do you decide and why?

What benefits do Arabic numerals have over Roman numerals as a way to represent numbers? For example, with Arabic numerals we have an obvious way to represent 0. Arabic numerals also typically require fewer characters to represent the same number, e.g., "3111" vs "MMMCXI".

What else? This is a useful exercise in understanding the relationship between how you represent your data and the actions you want to perform on your data—a dynamic you'll see at play in almost every piece of software you write.

For example, if we're counting people as they walk into a room by marking something on a piece of paper, Arabic numerals are a terrible representation. That'd be like trying to go for a hike and using a political map as a guide.

Instead, we opt for using [tally marks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks) to count.
